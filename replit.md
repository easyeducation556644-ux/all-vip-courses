# All Vip Course - Online Education Platform

## Overview

All Vip Course is a web-based online education platform built with React and Firebase. It enables users to browse courses, enroll through payment processing, and access course materials via Telegram groups. The platform includes an admin panel for managing courses, categories, and user enrollments with an approval workflow.

The application serves both free and paid educational content, with support for coupon codes, payment processing through RupantorPay (Bangladesh payment gateway), and secure Telegram group access upon enrollment approval.

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- **React 18.2** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite 5.0** as the build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM 6.21** for client-side routing
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support with dynamic manifest generation

**UI Component Library**
- **Radix UI primitives** for accessible, unstyled components (Dialog, Dropdown, Select, Toast, Tabs, etc.)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design tokens
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Custom component library** in `/components/ui` following shadcn/ui patterns

**Form Handling & Validation**
- **React Hook Form 7.60** for form state management
- **Zod 3.22** for schema validation
- **@hookform/resolvers** for integrating Zod with React Hook Form

**State Management Approach**
- Firebase Firestore real-time listeners for data synchronization
- Local component state with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Context API for authentication state
- No global state management library (Redux/Zustand) - relies on Firebase real-time updates

### Backend Architecture

**Server Setup**
- **Express.js 4.18** server serving both API endpoints and static React build
- **Node.js** runtime with ES modules (type: "module")
- Server handles both development (Vite dev server) and production (static files)

**API Endpoints Structure**
- `/api/create-payment` - Initiates RupantorPay payment session
- `/api/verify-payment` - Verifies payment status with RupantorPay
- `/api/payment-webhook` - Receives payment notifications from RupantorPay
- `/api/process-enrollment` - Processes manual enrollment and free enrollments
- `/api/upload-image` - Proxies image uploads to ImgBB API
- `/api/get-telegram-link` - Securely retrieves Telegram group links for approved enrollments
- `/api/update-enrollment-status` - Admin endpoint for approving/rejecting enrollments
- `/api/manifest.json` - Dynamic PWA manifest from Firestore settings

**Payment Processing Flow**
1. User initiates payment → `create-payment` API creates RupantorPay session
2. User completes payment on RupantorPay gateway
3. RupantorPay sends webhook → `payment-webhook` verifies and processes enrollment
4. Fallback: Frontend can call `verify-payment` and `process-enrollment` manually
5. Payment verification uses RupantorPay API to confirm transaction status
6. Upon successful payment, enrollment record created with "PENDING" status
7. Admin reviews and approves/rejects enrollment
8. Approved users can access secure Telegram group links

**Enrollment Approval Workflow**
- All enrollments start with "PENDING" status
- Admin reviews enrollment requests in admin panel
- Admin can approve or reject with optional reason
- Approved enrollments grant access to course Telegram groups
- Secure Telegram links generated with HMAC signatures for verification
