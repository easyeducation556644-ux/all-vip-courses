## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- **React 18.2** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite 5.0** as the build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM 6.21** for client-side routing
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support with dynamic manifest generation

**UI Component Library**
- **Radix UI primitives** for accessible, unstyled components (Dialog, Dropdown, Select, Toast, Tabs, etc.)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design tokens
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Custom component library** in `/components/ui` following shadcn/ui patterns

**Form Handling & Validation**
- **React Hook Form 7.60** for form state management
- **Zod 3.22** for schema validation
- **@hookform/resolvers** for integrating Zod with React Hook Form

**State Management Approach**
- Firebase Firestore real-time listeners for data synchronization
- Local component state with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Context API for authentication state
- No global state management library (Redux/Zustand) - relies on Firebase real-time updates

### Backend Architecture

**Server Setup**
- **Express.js 4.18** server serving both API endpoints and static React build
- **Node.js** runtime with ES modules (type: "module")
- Server handles both development (Vite dev server) and production (static files)

**API Endpoints Structure**
- `/api/create-payment` - Initiates RupantorPay payment session
- `/api/verify-payment` - Verifies payment status with RupantorPay
- `/api/payment-webhook` - Receives payment notifications from RupantorPay
- `/api/process-enrollment` - Processes manual enrollment and free enrollments
- `/api/upload-image` - Proxies image uploads to ImgBB API
- `/api/get-telegram-link` - Securely retrieves Telegram group links for approved enrollments
- `/api/update-enrollment-status` - Admin endpoint for approving/rejecting enrollments
- `/api/manifest.json` - Dynamic PWA manifest from Firestore settings

**Payment Processing Flow**
1. User initiates payment → `create-payment` API creates RupantorPay session
2. User completes payment on RupantorPay gateway
3. RupantorPay sends webhook → `payment-webhook` verifies and processes enrollment
4. Fallback: Frontend can call `verify-payment` and `process-enrollment` manually
5. Payment verification uses RupantorPay API to confirm transaction status
6. Upon successful payment, enrollment record created with "PENDING" status
7. Admin reviews and approves/rejects enrollment
8. Approved users can access secure Telegram group links

**Enrollment Approval Workflow**
- All enrollments start with "PENDING" status
- Admin reviews enrollment requests in admin panel
- Admin can approve or reject with optional reason
- Approved enrollments grant access to course Telegram groups
- Secure Telegram links generated with HMAC signatures for verification
